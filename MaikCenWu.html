    <p>Hi! I am a senior in Brooklyn College, who is trying to be better at programming. 
        Currently, I have issue with procrastination, 
        in which lead me to delay tasks and starts to doing them until the very last minute. 
        However, my issues with procrastination have slightly improved 
        and I have started to be more consistent with my schedule. 
        My goal after graduation is to be a software engineer, 
        but base on the current job market, I am also considering other roles in tech.
